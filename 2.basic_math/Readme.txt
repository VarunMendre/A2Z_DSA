🧠 A2Z DSA Sheet – My Learning Journey
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice repository!
This repo contains my solutions to the problems in the A2Z DSA Sheet, created by Take U Forward.

✅ Completed Sections
🔢 1. Basic Math
I’ve completed the following problems in this section:

 Counting Digits

 Reverse a Number

 Prime Number Check

 GCD or HCF

 Check Palindrome

 Check Armstrong Number

 Check All Divisors

📂 Each solution is written in a clean and understandable manner with comments explaining the logic.
