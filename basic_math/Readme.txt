# üß† A2Z DSA Sheet ‚Äì My Learning Journey

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice repository!
This repo contains my solutions to the problems in the [A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/), created by **Take U Forward**.

## ‚úÖ Completed Sections

### üî¢ 1. Basic Math

I‚Äôve completed the following problems in this section:

* [x] Counting Digits
* [x] Reverse a Number
* [x] Prime Number Check
* [x] GCD or HCF
* [x] Check Palindrome
* [x] Check Armstrong Number
* [x] Check All Divisors

üìÇ Each solution is written in a clean and understandable manner with comments explaining the logic.
